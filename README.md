# todo
Project provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

Meant to put the learners newly-found knowledge of OOP, ES6 modules, factory functions and similiar patterns to use. This module of the course delved deep into the unique
aspects of JS that make it the whacky but fun and open-ended langauge that it is.

I personally am also interested in giving the CSS Sass language, and JS libary jQuery a shot in this project, while also replicating some functionality I find interesting in jQuery in my own libary.

## Todo list specification
create a todo app that allows for multiple projects made up of todos. have a default project with a demo todo. have a minimalistic UI, resembling an email inbox: projects on the far left and todos center.

Seperate the code by functionality: Dom related modules that generate and keeps track of elements on the page. There should be a project and todo.

Data related modules that create objects, keeps track of all the projects and their todos, quaries to remove projects and todos, sorts todos based on prority.

Factory functions for projects and todos. Projects, title, todo list object for tracking todos, length of list. Todos, title, description, dueDate and priority, complete. If the todo is past its date, it should automatically be checked as complete.
