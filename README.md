Project provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

Meant to put the learners newly-found knowledge of OOP, ES6 modules, factory functions and similiar patterns to use. This module of the course delved deep into the unique
aspects of JS that make it the whacky but fun and open-ended langauge that it is.

I personally am also interested in giving the CSS Sass language, and JS libary jQuery a shot in this project, while also replicating some functionality I find interesting in jQuery in my own libary.
